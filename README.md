Implementation
--------------
The most natural and simplest way to search for information is using natural
language to describe it; this can be done with any modern Web search engine. By
using various _key_ words, the search engine can determine the best match and
present Web page results.

Do you know how the search engine came to that conclusion? No, it doesn't matter.
All that matters is that you found the information you were looking for. In order
for a search engine to succeed, it must have an index of the sites with relevant
descriptive information as well as be able to interpret the search string both
in content and context.

Avocado has a similar goal in that information retrieval should be transparent.
The difference? Web sites are virtually big blobs of text, semantic markup and
some extra metadata. Discrete data have a natural constraint based on their datatype.

The other advantage of discrete data is the ability to control what data you see
in the results and how your search criteria influence the search engine.

So what do I mean by discrete data?
